# Godot's Cookbook

An amalgamation of different experiments and useful practices.
Each folder contains an example.

# Version

Godot 3.3

# Using the samples

- Download or clone this repository
- With Godot, open the `project/project.godot` file
- Choose a scene from one of the folders and run it :)

# Project structure

At the top level, we have auxiliary files (this README, any assets that can be imported, bash scripts...).
The actual Godot project lives inside the `project` folder. This facilitates organization and VCS.

# Contributing

This started as a way for me to track different experiments but is open to any external contributions.

- Any new recipe should be properly documented and follow GDScript's styleguide.
- Contributions must be submitted with a PR
- Recipes should be small, laser-focused on what they intend to show. Avoid extreme boilerplate code.

# Requests

Open an issue! If it is sensible, someone can create a PR to solve it.
