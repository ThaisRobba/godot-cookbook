# Godot's Cookbook

An amalgamation of different experiments and useful practices.
Each folder contains an example.


# Contributing

This started as a way for me to track different experiments but is open to any external contributions.

- Any new recipe should be properly documented and follow GDScript's styleguide.
- Contributions must be submitted with a PR
- Recipes should be small, laser-focused on what they intend to show. Avoid extreme boilerplate code.

# Requests

Open an issue! If it is sensible, someone can create a PR to solve it.
